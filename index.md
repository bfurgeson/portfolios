[RETAIL - Superstore Product Sales Analysis (Tableau)](https://www.notion.so/brodiefurgeson/RETAIL-Superstore-Product-Sales-Analysis-2f92c3fbdc674757b6f59e2cf688463e)
The Superstore dataset from Tableau public contains information about products, sales, and profits that you can use to identify key areas of improvement within a fictitious big box superstore retail company. The purpose of the analysis was to produce a profitability dashboard to uncover insights into the profitability of the business across states, regions, categories and subcategories and identify general areas of improvement. 

Tableau is used to create a dashboard. The dashboard is segmented into State, Regional, Category, Sub-Category, and Brand level data by Gross Margin Profit to identify negatively profitable performing segments. Further, tooltips including top and bottom cities, products, etc as well as sales trends are included so area managers and category managers have better drill down visibility into the data.

[TRANSPORTATION - Cyclistic Ride Share User Behaviour Analysis (R Markdown, ggplot2, tidyverse)](https://www.notion.so/brodiefurgeson/TRANSPORTATION-Cyclistic-Ride-Share-User-Behaviour-Analysis-cc753001b1f447bbb4dc19b9c796fac0)

Cyclistic is a (fictitious) bike share company launched in 2016 in Chicago.

The purpose of this case is to determine, through an analysis of user data, how Cyclistic annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. The key deliverables are marketing campaign recommendations to the head of marketing, Lily Moreno supported by compelling data visuals she can present to the Cyclistic executive team. 

This study reveals several ways annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike share bikes differently.

Evidence suggest annual members are more likely to use bikes for commuting based on usage trends: - two daily peak ride times, 8:00AM and 5:00PM - weekday rides - more likely to ride even in colder months - shorter trip duration

Results of our analysis suggest casual members appear to be more likely to rider for pleasure and are more variable in usage: - afternoon peak time - weekend rides - very few rides outside during coldest months - longer trip duration (nearly double that of members)

This study was able to answer some descriptive questions (when, where, what, and how long they ride) and but further study is needed to understand causality (why they ride) and be able to predict rider behaviour on a more granular.
